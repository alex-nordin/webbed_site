# Project Purpose

To experiment with the leptos framework, and any other web technology I might like to add. Sort of an "everything but the kitchen sink type" of project.

## Building the Project

This repo provides a nix flake and provided you have installed nix on your system and enabled support for flakes, you can enter a development environment using ```nix run``` or build using ```nix build```.

See also the Justfile for commands to run inside the devshell to run/build.
